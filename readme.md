         - Button
    - HTML Element Property System
        - The 'id', used to identify element uniquely from DOM
        - The 'name', used to extract collection of DOM elements having 'same name' e.g. Element Collection OR Group
        - The 'class', used to extract collection of DOM elements having 'same name' e.g. Element Collection OR Group 

# JS Basics
1. window object
    - Represents an instance of Browser
        - Events
            - onload
            - onclose
2. document object
    - Represents HTML DOM loaded in the browser
    - USed to access HTML Elements from DOM to perform following operations
        - Access property of Element for Read/Write Operations
        - Access Element for attaching Events
        - Generate HTML Dynamically based on Data 
    - functions
        - getElementById('{id}'), extract single element based on 'id'
        - getElementsByName('{name}'), extract collection of elements
        - getElementsByClass('{class}'), extract collection of elements   
        - getElementsByTagName('{tag}'), return collection of elements of all matching tags
        - querySelector(CONDITION)
        - addEventListener(), used to attach an event to DOM Element
            - document.addEventListener('{EVENT-NAME}', function(){LOGIC-TO-EXECUTE}, BOOL-KEEP-EVENT-ATTACHED-TO-ELEMENT)
                - If true then the Function will always be attached with DOM Element
                - If false, then once the events raise is complete the function will be detached from Element         
    - VAriable is declared using 'var'              

# JS Programming (Included in TypeScript)
- Variable is declared using 'var'
- There is no explicit Data Type available
- Data TYpes are Parsed based on 'initial-value-of-variable'
    - e.g. var i = 10; 
        - here 'i' is number
    - Parsed Types
        - number, string, boolean
            - number includes 'integer' and 'floating' type values
            - string using '' or "" both are same
    - Complex Types with methods
        - object
            -  used to store Complex data like JSON data
                - e.g.
                    - {KEY:VALUE}
        - Date
            - USed to Manage Date Formats on Client-Side based on OS Date-Time settings
                - UTC Timings
        - function
            - Power of JS for Building 'MULTI-MODULE-APP'
            - Reference Functions
                - STore the function Implementation into a variable, and use it as a class 
                    - e.g.
                        - var obj = function(){......}
            - CLose Function aka Function Object
                - CReate a function, that returns an Object which we can use as class
                    - e.g.
                        - function MyObject(){...... return { PUBLIC METHODS }}
            - Immediatly Invokable Function Expression aka IIFE 
                - also known as 'Self-Executable' JavaScript
                - Also used to Create 'MODULE' in JavaScript            
        - Array also represented as '[]'         
            - STore large Data equal to Memory available for Browser
            - Methods
                - sort(), reverse(), search(), find(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), reduce(), splice(), slice(), shift(), unshift(), map() forEach(), filter() etc.
